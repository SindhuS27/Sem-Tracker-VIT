# 🎀 VIT Semester Marks Tracker by Sindhu 🎀

This is a personalized **Python + SQLite** application developed by me (Sindhu 💖) specifically for **VIT students** to manage and track their semester marks efficiently and cutely!

## 🎓 Why I Built This
As a VITian myself, I noticed the need for a tool that:
- Reflects VIT's internal mark structure (CATs, FATs, DAs)
- Stores everything in one place
- Is quick and easy to use, even during exams season 😅

## 💡 Features:
✨ Track marks for multiple subjects  
✨ Calculates your final score with exact weightage  
✨ Stores your data securely in a local database  
✨ Displays your scores in a fancy CLI table  

## 📊 VIT Internal Weightage System:
| Component | Max Marks | Weightage |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| CAT1      | 50        | 15%       |
| CAT2      | 50        | 15%       |
| FAT       | 100       | 40%       |
| DA1       | 10        | 10%       |
| DA2       | 10        | 10%       |
| DA3       | 10        | 10%       |

> Total Score = Weighted CATs + FAT + DAs = 💯
